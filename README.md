A book of my statistics notes.

This repository is formatted as a bookdown book using R Markdown. It is not compiled using Jeckyll.  When calling 

```
bookdown::render_book()
```

The book will render to the `docs` directory.  This is set up by adding the line

```
output_dir: "docs"
```

to the `_bookdown.yml` file.
